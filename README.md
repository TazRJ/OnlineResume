Online resume project using JavaScript, HTML &amp; CSS

This was a little project I had done in a couple days to improve my HTML, CSS and JS skills as a beginner coder about to enter the workforce!

Javascript was used in the HTML file!

I had used a few open source button copy/pastes in the interest of saving time.
